  <h2>My Story</h2> 
  <div class="col-sm-4">  
    <p>Hello, I’m a full-stack web developer from Bogotá, Colombia. I have experience in the field as an Object Oriented Programmer and I am looking for an opportunity to use my knowledge to be an asset to a company in need. After graduating from college I learned several programming languages including C++ and JavaScript and with hard work and study I developed a passion for programming. 

    Since then I have finished a coding bootcamp in the City of Bogotá and have worked on several open source projects (go to my portfolio) and on my personal coding blog.
